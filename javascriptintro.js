// Loops - a loop is a construct that allows me to repeat a specified task.


// Variables- a variable can be thought of like a bucket
var car = 'bmw 5Series'
var car2 = 'audi a8'
var car3 = 'dodge challenger'

//Arrays - are a list of values

var cars = ['bmw','audi','dodge']


// Loops - a loop is a construct that allows me to repeat a specified task.

for (var x=0; x<cars.length; x++) {
console.log(x)
}
